README file for Audacious package for Frugalware GNU/Linux.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This package is a fork of BMP (Beep Media Player) and is not
rewritten correctly everything. So the BMP and the Audacious
cannot run at the same time. There are not any file conflicts
except a socket file in /tmp, but this file is deleted when the
program is stopped. Winamp2, BMP and XMMS skins can be used.
