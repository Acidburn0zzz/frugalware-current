If you want to test this package, you can use for example the server of
VoipBuster (http://www.voipbuster.com/en/index.html).

First, you should register a user name and password with their native
(Windows-only) client. After that give iax.voipbuster.com as the server and
your just registered username and password.

Now you should able to dial (currently the first minute is for free).
