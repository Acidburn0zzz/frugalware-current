# /etc/sysconfig/submount
# configuration file for rc.submount

# mode can be:
# - 'manual' - no nothing
# - 'symlink' - create floppy,cdrom,dvd,cdrecorder,dvdrecorder symlinks if
#               necessary
# - 'dirs' - deletes floppy,cdrom,dvd,cdrecorder,dvdrecorder dirs in /mnt and
#            creates wich is necessary, also creates entries in fsab, but you
#            have to mount devices manually
# - 'auto' - same as dirs, but automatically mounts devices via submount
#            (submount automatically mounts and unmounts these devices)

mode=auto

# mountopts: extra options we have to use when creating fstab (mode=dirs,auto)
# sample: mountopts=iocharset=iso8859-2,codepage=852
