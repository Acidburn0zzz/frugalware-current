Unp informations:

unp is a small perl script which makes extraction of any archive files
easier. It support several compressors and archiver programs, chooses the
right one(s) automatically and extracts one or more files in one go. It
detects the right type from the file extensions or the "file" output.

unp was written by André Karwath (http://www.aka-online.de) in 1997, I
(Eduard Bloch <blade@debian.org>) found it later and improved it to fill 
my needs. Have fun!
