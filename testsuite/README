Frugalware Source Tree Testsuite
================================

Basically there are 3 simple rules for these tests:
- if one start with no argument, they should print the usage
- if the test passes, there should be no output (if this is mentioned, then
  there can be a --verbose option)
- they should have the .sh suffix

That's all.
