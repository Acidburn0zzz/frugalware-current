    Package updates:
    * Added virt-manager and gnome-applet-vm packages as GUI tools for Xen
    * Tracker, a desktop search tool, now enabled by default in GNOME for
      lightning-fast searching
    * GNOME 2.17.3, with new features and bug fixes
    * Xfce 4.4 Release Candidate 2, with a lot of bug fixes
    * Beryl 0.1.3 with lots of new eye-candy effects
    * Linux Kernel 2.6.19
    * Curl 7.16.0
    * DBUS 1.0 with several improvements and fixes
    * HAL 0.5.8.1 with new features and bug fixes
    * dhcpcd 3.0, resulting in more reliable network autoconfiguration

    Improvements:
    * Added KDE support to fw-xgl-control and Beryl.
    * Gnome-mount, a replacement for pmount in GNOME resulting in more reliable
      and flexible automounting in GNOME

    Setup:
    * Much improved error handling. A dialog box will be displayed in the
      unlikely event of a segmentation fault and the installer will exit,
      instead of just restarting from the beginning.
    * Use libalpm to download the package database, which gives better error
      handling. If the database update fails, you will be told about it,
      instead of being given an empty category list.
    * There is now an option to go back to a previous step in the installer
      (where it makes sense).
    * CD/DVD installation is now faster: integrity and conflict checks are done
      before creating the installation images.
    * There is floppy image available now for tftp installs.
