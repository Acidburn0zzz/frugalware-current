Frugalware (1.4)

  rc2: pending
    * Package updates:
      * Drupal 7 obsoletes Drupal 5. If a drupal-5 package has its own drupal-6 counterpart (eg. drupal-cck),
        then the drupal-6 one (drupal6-cck) replaces the old one automatically. If a drupal-5 package DOES NOT
        have its own drupal6 counterpart, then the drupal6 package replaces it - sorry for the inconvenience,
        those drupal-5 bastards are not even supported by upstream.
      * Linux 2.6.37
      * KDE 4.5

      * systemd is now available as an alternative of sysvinit (it's not
        the default).
