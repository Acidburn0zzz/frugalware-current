Frugalware (0.6)

  pre2: pending

  Package updates:
    * Added virt-manager and gnome-applet-vm packages as GUI tools for Xen
    * Tracker - Desktop search tool, now enabled by default in GNOME for
      lightning-fast searching

  Improvements:
    * Added KDE support to fw-xgl-control.

  Setup:
    * Much improved error handling. A dialog box will be displayed in the
      unlikely event of a segmentation fault and the installer will exit,
      instead of just restarting from the beginning.
    * Use libalpm to download the package database, which gives better error
      handling. If the database update fails, you will be told about it,
      instead of being given an empty category list.

    * firefox-2.0 with improved tabbed browsing and inline spell checking
    * xfce 4.4rc1: This fixes all plugin crash problems with the old Xfce 4.2.x
      and the new version is much more stable.
    * kde-3.5.5 with KHTML improvements, and support for sudo in kdesu
    * openoffice.org-2.0.4 with a latex export filter and encryption support in
      the pdf export filter

      cause a considerable performance increase in newly built packages

    Improvements:
    * All installed-by-default packages are now built using gcj/ecj, javac is
