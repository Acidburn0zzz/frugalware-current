  pre1: pending

    Package updates:
    * glibc-2.5 with support for the new ELF hash table format
    * xfce 4.4rc1: This fixes all plugin crash problems with the old Xfce 4.2.x
      and the new version is much more stable.
    * kde-3.5.5 with KHTML improvements, and support for sudo in kdesu
    * openoffice.org-2.0.4 with a latex export filter and encryption support in
      the pdf export filter
    * dbus-0.93
    * neon-0.26.1 with internationalization support
    * Xen 3.0-unstable with HVM and XenFB support && 2.6.18 for Xen kernels
    * db-4.5.20 with Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) support
    * python-2.5 with an interesting mix of language and library improvements

    New packages:
    * Added PHP documentation for 23 languages.

    Improvements:
    * All packages are now built using gcj/ecj, javac is only provided as an
      alternate compiler.

    Setup:
    * Installing from an usb stick is now supported.
    * Much improved error handling. A dialog box will be displayed in the
      unlikely event of a segmentation fault and the installer will exit,
      instead of just restarting from the beginning.
    * Use libalpm to download the package database, which gives better error
      handling. If the database update fails, you will be told about it,
      instead of being given an empty category list.
