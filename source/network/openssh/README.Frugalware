=== Forwarding ports

--------------------------------------
# ssh -L 8000:server.com:80 server.com
--------------------------------------

After this you can access server.com:80 at localhost:8000 even if server.com:80
is not accessible from your machine. In case you don't have ssh to server.com
but you have one to a machine which is allowed to access server.com:80, use

--------------------------------------
# ssh -L 8000:server.com:80 ssh.server.com
--------------------------------------

=== Socks proxy

Many mobile users have the following problem: they have to use an unencrypted
wireless lan and they want to access webservers which does not support https.
There is an easy solution for this: you transfer data to a server in an ssh
tunnel then the data can be transferred to the server unencrypted in a wired
network. This is much more secure. Set up the socks proxy on localhost:8080:

--------------------------------------
$ ssh -D 8080 server.com
--------------------------------------

Then configure your webbrowser to use the proxy, for example in firefox, select
`Manual proxy configuration` and then set `SOCKS Host` to localhost, `Port` to
8080.

NOTE: Don't forget to clear other proxy fields! (HTTP, SSL, FTP, etc)
