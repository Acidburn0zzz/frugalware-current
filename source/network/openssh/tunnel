# example #1: access server.com:customport
# - use compression
# - sshd running on port 1022
# - use login name user
# - use local port 5901
# - use remote port 5901
# - remote machine is server.com
# this way you can access a server.com:5901 at localhost:5902 if it's not
# accessible directly from localhost
#tunnels=(${tunnels[@]} "-C -p 1022 -l user -L5901:localhost:5901 server.com")

# example #2: access server.com from ssh.server.com
# - use login name user
# - local port is 8000
# - remote machine is server.com
# - remote port is 80
# - the gateway machine is ssh.server.com
# this way you can access server.com:80 at localhost:8000 if it's accessible
# from ssh.server.com but not from localhost
#tunnels=(${tunnels[@]} "-l user -L 8000:server.com:80 ssh.server.com")
