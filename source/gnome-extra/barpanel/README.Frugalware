Some tips and trick for use with barpanel:

* Copy the config.xml.in in the package to ~/.barpanel/config.xml to be able 
to create your own local changes. You can find its location with pacman-g2 
-Ql barpanel.

* Barpanel themes are simply gtk2 themes, so if you want it to match your own
gtk theme, a simple way you can try is this: 
cd ~/.barpanel/themes
ln -s (path to your gtk theme)/gtk-2.0 (name of theme)

Then, change the theme in your ~/.barpanel/config.xml configuration file.

Enjoy.
