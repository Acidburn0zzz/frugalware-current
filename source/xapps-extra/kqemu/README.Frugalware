If you want to use kqemu, you need to mount `tmpfs` on `/dev/shm`. This is not
problematic, `qemu` prints a usable error message if you miss that. The problem
is that you have to do this again and again after each reboot. If you hate
this, then just add the following line to your `/etc/fstab`:

----
tmpfs            /dev/shm         tmpfs       defaults,size=144m         0   0
----
