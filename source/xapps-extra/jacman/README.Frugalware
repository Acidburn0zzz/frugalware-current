Jacman needs a '/etc/pacman.conf' with some modifications.

Here an example of the original /etc/pacman.conf:

------------------------------------------
Include = /etc/pacman.d/frugalware-current
------------------------------------------

If you want to work with jacman you must change this lines to:

------------------------------------------
# -current
[frugalware-current]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/frugalware-current
------------------------------------------

This changes have not any effect to pacman. But for jacman these are necessary.
