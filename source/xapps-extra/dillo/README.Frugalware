Dillo is moving to FLTK2. As of 2006-04-29 it is unstable
(both unreleased and has some random erratic bugs, but upstream
is working on it), and some KDE stuff has fltk dep, so not a good idea
to mess with. 

Dillo is now "crippled" by removing the new FLTK based download GUI, as it
is only this needs FLTK2, but for the next release more FLTK2 expected.
