If you do not know the keycodes for the keys you wish to remap the joystick events
to, then please install the xev program. It will help you to identify them. Moving
on, the /etc/kbstick.conf is the system level configuration file the shell script
reads from if the user does not have a .kbstickrc in their home directory. Syntax
is the same in both cases, and the configuration file has some comments to give you
an idea of what each variable does. I have set the default up/down/left/right key
mappings to what my laptop uses for them and the buttons will have to be manually
defined to their proper keycodes. If you need any further help, please email the
maintainer of this package.
