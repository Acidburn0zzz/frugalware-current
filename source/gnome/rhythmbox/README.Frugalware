If you upgraded from a version where Rhythmbox hung while importing songs,
you must delete your rhythmbox database otherwise the problem will still
occur. This can be done by running the following command as the user
you want to rebuild the database for:
--------------------------
rm -Rf ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox
--------------------------
