After installing cpuspeed, make sure you edit the configuration file
before starting it. The configuration file is located in /etc/cpuspeed.conf

Set the correct CPUFreq driver name in the confiuration file by setting the DRIVER value.
for eg: if you want to use the p4-clockmod driver, your cpuspeed configuration file
should contain DRIVER="p4-clockmod"

For a list of drivers, check this directory
/lib/modules/_your_kernel_version_/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq
