This app does not have any webserver, SQL server nor IMAP server in its
depends, which is intentional. Anyway, if you plan to use it, you should set
up a webserver and an IMAP server. The SQL server is optional, but it's the
most easiest-to-use preferences container.

Additionally this app is not configured in any way: there are far too many
customizable settings, so the packager cannot know how to set them for your
particular needs. Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
