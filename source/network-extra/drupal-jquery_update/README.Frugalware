According to this module's documentation (available eg. at
+/var/www/drupal/sites/all/modules/jquery_update/README.txt+), some of
Drupal's own +.js+ files must be overwritten with the ones shipped with this
module. This is done automatically when installing/upgrading this package, but
upgrading the +drupal+ package will revert those files (and Drupal will whine
at the administration area). Reinstalling this package (or copy the files over
by hand) should stop the whining.
