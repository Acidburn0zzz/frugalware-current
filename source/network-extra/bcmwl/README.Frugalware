This package is an alternative to the in-tree `b43` driver. Use it only
in case the `b43` one does not work for you!

To use it, add the followings to `/etc/sysconfig/blacklist`:

----
blacklist b43
blacklist ssb
blacklist lib80211
----

NOTE: You may need to blacklist `ohci_hcd` as well, if that's loaded on
your system.

and add the followings to `/etc/sysconfig/modules`:

----
lib80211_crypt_tkip
wl
----
