You have to GRANT some privileges (at least for the operating user) to be able
to use this package, as the installer does not GRANT them. The operating user
requires ALTER, SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE privileges. For installation, INDEX,
CREATE, DELETE, and DROP privileges are also required - this can be carried out
if you provide the (MySQL) superuser's credentials to the installer.

Do not forget to +rm -rf /var/www/mantis/admin+ after a successful install to
prevent hijacking your bugtracker, and chage the default administrator's
password.
