Configuration examples can be found in /etc/hostapd.
You must edit the following files located in /etc/hostapd to configure hostapd:

hostapd.allow
hostapd.conf
hostapd.deny

The daemon script usable via the service command expects you to have configured
it properly via these files before it can be used.
