To be able to use this package as intended, you will have to:

* set up apache to access `/var/www/egroupware` from the web the way you like

* install and set up your favourite SQL database (mysql, postgresql or
  oracle), this package DOES NOT depend on any of them)

* create and/or grant access to the database

* set up your eGroupware installation itself by entering the correct credentials
at the install screen to be able to reach the above-mentioned database.
