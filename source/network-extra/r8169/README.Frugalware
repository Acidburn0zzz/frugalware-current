== About the driver

This is the r8169 driver from realtek. This in _not_ the same r8169
presented in linux kernel.

This driver supports: RTL8169S/8110S, RTL8169SB/8110SB, RTL8110SC

== Using the driver

To use this driver you have to remove the offcial r8169 if loaded.

	rmmod r8169

You can load this module with

	modprobe realtek-r8169

It might be a good idea to blacklist r8169 nad add realtek-r8169 to
/etc/sysconfig/modules, so you do not have to play thig game after
every reboot.
