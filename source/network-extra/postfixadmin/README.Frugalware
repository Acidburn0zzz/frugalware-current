This package relies on correct install of postfix's virtual tables and it
needs to be configured before usage. Be sure to read upstream's
+/var/www/postfixadmin/INSTALL.TXT+ in order to accomplish the setup
or upgrade. You should also take care of configuring apache to be able to
use the web-based interface.
