=== Introduction

Pootle provides a separate webserver, after starting it, you should be able to
reach it at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

=== Creating users

No-one can login to Pootle by default. You should edit
`/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Pootle/users.prefs`, and uncomment the
'startup' user. Its password is 'startup', too. Then login via the web
interface, create an account. Finally edit the configuration file again and
comment the 'startup' user.
