jacman needs a /etc/pacman.conf with some modifications.

Here an example of the original /etc/pacman.conf:

# -current
Include = /etc/pacman.d/frugalware-current
Include = /etc/pacman.d/extra-current

If you want to work with jacman you must change this lines to:

# -current
[frugalware-current]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/frugalware-current
[extra-current]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/extra-current

This changes haven't any effect to pacman. But for jacman it's necessary.
