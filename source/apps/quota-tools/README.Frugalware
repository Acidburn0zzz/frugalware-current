To really activate quotas, you'll need to add `usrquota` to the appropriate
partitions as listed in `/etc/fstab`.  Here's an example:

----
/dev/hda2   /home   ext2   defaults,usrquota    1   1
----

When you want quota support for a given partition, some special files have to
be created boot-time. This is not done by default. To do so, you need to

----
# touch /var/lib/quota/new
----

then, reboot to create those files.

To edit user quotas, use `edquota`.  See `man edquota`.
