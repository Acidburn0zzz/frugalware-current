This is a small tool for the 32bit emulation in linux/x86-64. It allows
to execute programs that need an uname -m of i386 with uname emulation.

Installation:

gcc -o linux32 linux.c
cp linux32 /usr/local/bin
ln /usr/local/bin/linux32 /usr/local/bin/linux64

Syntax: 

linux32 <program> [arguments...] 

Run program with uname -m = i386

linux64 <program> [arguments...]

Run program with uname -m = x86_64 (that's the default)

The uname -m is inherited to all childs of programs, but doesn't affect
the current shell or processes above it in the process hierarchy. 
Needs a fairly recent CVS kernel as of 2002-05-01.
