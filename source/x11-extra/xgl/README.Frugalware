1. *Xgl server*
+
Xgl is a hardware accelerated X server. It renders everything that gets drawn 
to the screen with OpenGL to allow for fancy effects like wobbly windows, 
translucency, etc. The disadvantage to Xgl is that programs that already use 
OpenGL will not work on it. Xgl is only recommended if you do not have a 
graphics card that supports GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap.

2. *AIGLX*
+
Accelerated Indirect GLX ("AIGLX") is an open source project founded by Red Hat 
and the Fedora Linux community to allow accelerated indirect GLX rendering 
capabilities to X.Org and DRI drivers. This allows remote X clients to get fully 
hardware accelerated rendering over the GLX protocol; coincidentally, this development 
was required for OpenGL compositing window managers (such as Compiz) to function with 
hardware acceleration.

3. *Compiz Fusion*
+
Compiz Fusion is the result of a merge between the well-known Beryl composite window 
manager and Compiz Extras, a community set of improvements to the Compiz composite window 
manager. Compiz Fusion aims to provide an easy and fun-to-use windowed environment, 
allowing use of the graphics hardware to render each individual window and the entire 
screen, to provide some impressive effects, speed and usefulness.

NOTE: Before starting with installing compiz fusion, make sure you remove all
beryl packages installed on your system. Beryl is now merged with compiz-fusion
and is no longer supported on frugalware.

=== Setting it up

This section describes how to setup Xgl or AIGLX depending on which graphics card you have.

==== Intel Graphics Cards (i810)

This section describes how to setup Xgl/AIGLX on computers having Intel Graphics Cards.
First, make sure that the Intel Xorg drivers are installed. You can install it using:

---------------------------
# pacman-g2 -S xf86-video-i810
---------------------------

I would recommend using AIGLX and NOT xgl for intel users. This is because Xgl works extremely slow on
such cards. On the other hand, AIGLX is much faster than Xgl and is easier to setup. This section 
describes how to setup AIGLX for Intel GMA series cards.

You have to edit the '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' as root.

Look for Section "Module" and make sure that the following lines exist in that section

----------------
  Load    "dri"
  Load    "glx"
  Load    "dbe"
----------------

Now, look for Section "Device" and add the following lines to it

---------------------------------------------
  Option      "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" "true"
  Option      "DRI"                   "true"
---------------------------------------------

And add this to Section "ServerLayout"

-----------------------------
  Option      "AIGLX"  "true"
-----------------------------

Now look for Section "DRI". Create it if it doesn't exist and make sure it looks like the following

---------------------
  Section     "DRI"
  	Group       "video"
  	Mode        0660
  EndSection
---------------------

NOTE: Also please make sure you are in the `video` group.

Finally, add this line to Section "Extensions"

--------------------------------
  "Option" "Composite" "Enable"
--------------------------------

Save the file and exit the editor. Reboot your system. Your system should now be set up to use Compiz Fusion.
Now read on to the Window Manager setup section!

==== NVIDIA Graphics Cards

If you have an nVidia card, you're in luck - you can use all the fancy effects without the need for Xgl. 
This means you'll get much better performance. First of all, you'll need the latest nVidia drivers (100.14.11-6). 
Install them if you haven't already done it.

------------------
# pacman-g2 -Sy nvidia
------------------

Now, as i stated earlier, you can use it with or without Xgl. Both the ways are described below.

===== Without XGL

You have to edit the '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' as root.

First find the Device section for your nVidia card. Add the following line to it:

--------------------------------------------
 Option      "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" "false"
--------------------------------------------

Now go to the Screen section. Make sure the following lines are there:

-------------------------------------------
 Option     "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"
 Option     "RenderAccel" "true"
 Option     "Coolbits" "1"
 Option     "TripleBuffer" "true"
 Option     "AllowGLXWithComposite" "True"
-------------------------------------------

Finally, make sure the Composite extension is enabled. If it's not, add these lines to the bottom of the file:

---------------------------------------
 Section "Extensions"
    Option     "Composite" "Enable"
 EndSection
---------------------------------------

Save the file, and then reboot. Your system should now be set up to use Compiz Fusion.

===== With XGL

This section describes how to use Xgl on a system with an Nvidia card.
First of all, you'll need to install Xgl. This can be done by running:

-----------------
#  pacman-g2 -Sy xgl
-----------------

Once installed, xgl can be enabled by initiating the following command (as root) :

--------------------------
# fw-xgl-control --enable
--------------------------

To disable Xgl, run the following command (as root) :

---------------------------
# fw-xgl-control --disable
---------------------------

Every time xgl is enabled or disabled, you need to restart GDM. This can be
done by running the following command (as root) :

--------------
# gdm-restart
--------------

Now read on to the Window Manager setup section!

=== Window Manager Setup

Now you need to install a window manager to be able to get all these fancy effects. Frugalware currently has 
compiz-fusion window manager that can be used with XGL or AIGLX. 
Note that Frugalware no longer supports Beryl.

==== Compiz Fusion

This section describes how to setup / use Compiz Fusion as the window manager with XGL / AIGLX depending
on your Desktop environment.

===== XFCE

Run the following command (as root) to install the necessary packages:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  pacman-g2 -Sy compiz compiz-emerald compiz-emerald-themes fusion-icon ccsm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can simply fire up Fusion Icon from your Xfce menu. An icon should appear in your system tray. 
Right click it and go to Select Window Manager. Choose "Compiz" from the list. If at any time you wish to 
return to your normal window manager, just select it from the fusion icon.

If it works, you should add fusion-icon to the startup programs in your desktop environment. This can be 
done by going to *Settings -> Autostarted Applications* in your Xfce menu.

===== GNOME

Run the following command (as root) to install the necessary packages:

------------------------------------------
# pacman-g2 -Sy compiz-gnome fusion-icon ccsm
------------------------------------------

Now you can simply fire up Fusion Icon from your GNOME menu. An icon should appear in your system tray. 
Right click it and go to Select Window Manager. Choose "Compiz" from the list. If at any time you wish to 
return to your normal window manager, just select it from the fusion icon.

If it works, you should add fusion-icon to the startup programs so that it automatically starts everytime 
you login into GNOME. This can be done by going to *System -> Preferences -> Sessions -> Startup Programs* 
in your Gnome menu.

By default, compiz-gnome is shipped with gtk-window-decorator. Gnome users can also use Emerald as 
a window decorator with compiz. To install emerald, run (as root):

--------------------------------------------------
# pacman-g2 -Sy compiz-emerald compiz-emerald-themes
--------------------------------------------------

Once installed, you can switch to emerald as the window decorator. To do this, just right click the Fusion icon, 
navigate to "Select Window Decorator" and select "emerald" from the list.

===== KDE

Run the following command (as root) to install the necessary packages:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
# pacman-g2 -Sy compiz-kde fusion-icon ccsm taskbar-compiz kicker-compiz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now use compiz by starting Fusion Icon from the KDE menu.

By default, compiz-kde is shipped with kde-window-decorator. Kde users can also use Emerald as 
a window decorator with compiz. To install emerald, run (as root):

--------------------------------------------------
# pacman-g2 -Sy compiz-emerald compiz-emerald-themes
--------------------------------------------------

Once installed, you can switch to emerald as the window decorator. To do this, just right click the Fusion icon, 
navigate to "Select Window Decorator" and select "emerald" from the list.
