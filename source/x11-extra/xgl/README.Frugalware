1) Introduction

1_1) Xgl server

Xgl is a new hardware accelerated X server. Although it is still in development,
It's found OK for day-to-day use. It's especially good for Gnome and Xfce users
who want a bit of Mac OS X-like eye-candy.

1_2) Compiz

Compiz is a new window manager that has been specifically designed to be used
with Xgl. Unfortunately, if you are a KDE user, this will not work for you
(yet). Compiz provides some great effects demonstrated in the images/movies
below.

2_2 Movies

We currently have 2 movies of Xgl in action. We may add more in the future.
Note that these movies may jump or skip bits, as they were filmed on my trusty
700Mhz Pentium 3 :)

3) Getting it working (for Gnome)

Note that this *only* works for nVidia, i810 and ATI users currently! nVidia users, 
please make sure that you have the nVidia binary drivers set up and working correctly
(pacman -Sy nvidia)

Fire up your Gnome Terminal, Xterm, Linux Console, or whatever. Do

	su -

Enter your root password, then run:

	pacman -Sy mesa-cvs xgl compiz-cvs

Now run:

	`fw-xgl-control --enable`

Now you can reboot (or run gdm-restart as root, for advanced users), and hopefully 
you will be running on a nice fancy desktop :)

4) Getting it working (for KDE)

Note that this *only* works for nVidia, i810 and ATI users currently! nVidia users, 
please make sure that you have the nVidia binary drivers set up and working correctly
(pacman -Sy nvidia)

Fire up your Konsole, Xterm, Linux Console, or whatever. Do

	`su -`

Enter your root password, then run:

	`pacman -Sy xgl kicker-compiz taskbar-compiz beryl beryl-manager \
		beryl-plugins beryl-dbus beryl-settings emerald emerald-themes`

Now run:

	`fw-xgl-control --enable`

Now you can reboot (or restart KDM, for advanced users), and hopefully 
you will be running on a nice fancy desktop :)
