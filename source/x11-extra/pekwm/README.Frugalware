Be sure to make your own file at $HOME/.pekwm/autostart if you use pekwm-session
to auto-launch commands when you startup. I know pekwm has a start file for
this, but my method launches it *only* at the start of your session, while the
method pekwm uses starts everytime you restart/start pekwm. Use it well. You can
find an example below:

dbus-session --exit-with-session --sh-syntax &
feh --bg-scale "$HOME/.foo/bar" &
