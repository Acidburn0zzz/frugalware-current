I have purposely left out a few perl modules from the dependencies array,
because they are not needed to run perlpanel and drag in a lot of GNOME or
other stuff you may not want. Below, you will find a list of these modules and
what they do. If you find errors in this documentation, then please report it
and I will look into it.

perl-xmms - perlpanel plugin interface to xmms
perl-gnome2-vfs - various gnome plugin interfaces for perlpanel
libgnomeui - for full libglade support in perlpanel
