I have included a custom shell script called icewm-menus, for use with the icewm
menu file. An example menus file is also include at /usr/share/icewm/menus. It
uses standard shell syntax, so you can easily use shell variables, etc, to
create dynamic menus in icewm through my script and the usage of your local
$HOME/.icewm/menus file. To use it, use the following syntax in your menu file:
menuprog "(folder name)" (icon name) icewm-menus (menu switch to use)
If setup correctly, you'll wind up with menus generated by the output of the
shell script. Have fun configuring icewm.
