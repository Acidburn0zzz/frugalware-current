## packages to be cleaned

- avahi: all packages guarded by $USE_GTK3

## packages to be removed

- libjpeg: replaced by libjpeg-turbo
- mysql:   replaced by mariadb

## package *need* fixing

- ca-certificates: java-part need be an own package , so not split but duplicated
                   ( also we should check the depends since openjdk -> openjre -> ca-certificates <- openjre )
