= GNUstep Bump HOWTO

You *MUST* follow this HOWTO when bumping GNUstep to a new version (even a minor
version).

To start, packages must be compiled in the order listed below (if you find a
change that needs to be made to this list, poke Priyank).

== GNUstep (core) compile order

- gnustep-make
- gnustep-base
- gnustep-gui
- gnustep-back

== Other GNUstep libs and apps

If you bump any (except gnustep-make) or all of the core packages, it is necessary that you 
rebuild the following packages in the same order:

- gnustep-performance
- pantomime
- renaissance
- camerakit
- camera
- rigs
- gorm
- wizardkit
- highlighterkit
- keyarcher
- plconv
- projectmanager
- preview
- systempreferences
- gworkspace
- steptalk
- etoile

== Adding new GNUstep packages

- If you're adding a new package, make sure you use 'Finclude gnustep' in your FB. This sets up 
the build environment required to build a gnustep application.

- Every gnustep app/lib must have *gcc-objc* as it's makedepends() and
  atleast *gnustep-make* and *libojbc* in it's depends(). This will be done automatically if you use 'Finclude gnustep'.

- The primary group of the package should be *gnustep-extra*

- The secondary group of the package is optional, but it is preferable that you include a secondary group.
 If the package is a library, then the secondary group should be *gnustep-libs* or if it's an application 
then the secondary group should be *gnustep-apps*.
