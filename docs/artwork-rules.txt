= Artwork requirements

== Introduction

This document details the requirements that must be met by all artwork
if it is to be accepted into the official Frugalware gallery.

== The rules

* All artwork must be licensed under the Free Art License 1.3
  (link:http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/[full details]).

* Where the Frugalware logo appears, only the officially approved logo
  may be used. Refer
  link:http://frugalware.org/images/logo-new-big.png[here] for the logo.

* Artwork must be submitted in SVG format as this allows for
  derivative works to be made without affecting the impact of the
  original artwork. Examples of derivative works include wallpapers in
  various sizes and height/width ratios, and/or KDM/GDM/SLiM themes.

* All artwork must be submitted together with any associated source
  files - i.e. files which are required by the graphics editor used by
  the entrant to reproduce and/or edit the artwork.

* Only FLOSS software may be used to create the wallpaper.

* Neither the release's version number, nor code-name are to appear in
  artwork, or there should be a version without them for later use when
  a given release is no longer supported.
