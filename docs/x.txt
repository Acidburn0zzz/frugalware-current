= Graphical interface (X11)

== Configuring your graphics card

If you install X, setup will run xconfig, our X configuration utility
automatically. First, xconfig will detect your configuration and will
create a basic configuration file. Then it will ask you to specify the
screen resolution and colour depth. Finally, it will create the real
configuration file, with the following extras:

* Automatically configures the mouse wheel, if found
* Sets keyboard layout according to the selected language
* Enables DPMS
* Enables users to use the DRI extension

After generating the config file, setup will start the X server.
You must click the OK button to confirm to xconfig that the configuration
was successful.

== 3D acceleration, binary drivers

If there is built-in 3d acceleration support for your card in X, xconfig
will add the necessary entries to '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' and X will load
the module(s).

If you have an ATI or NVIDIA card, you probably need the manufacturer's
binary drivers. Obtaining the NVIDIA binary driver is fairly simple:

`su -c \'pacman -Sy nvidia\'`

If you have an ATI card, installation will not be more complicated
than a simple

`su -c \'pacman -Sy fglrx\'`

== Allow root login in KDM/GDM

By default, no root login is permitted on the GUI, the recommended way of
running graphical programs as root is to use gksu or kdesu.

To enable it anyway, the following lines should be edited:

For KDM ('/usr/share/config/kdm/kdmrc')

'AllowRootLogin=false'

modify to

'AllowRootLogin=true'

For GDM ('/etc/gdm/gdm.conf')

'AllowRoot=false'

modify to

'AllowRoot=true'
