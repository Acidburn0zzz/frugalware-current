= IRC Rules

== Introduction

This document describes the rules to be followed by everyone who joins
the users' and/or developers' IRC channels of Frugalware Linux.

== Welcome

You have joined us on IRC, to get help from or to give help to other Frugalware
users. We're sure you have made a good decision :) This document details a few
basic rules that should be followed on IRC. The rules are documented here so
that they're available to everyone.

== IRC channels

.There are four (4) Frugalware Linux channels
* frugalware (Main, English-language only)
* frugalware.hu (Hungarian-language only)
* frugalware.fr (French-language only)
* frugalware.dev (Frugalware development discussion.  Only Frugalware
  developers can 'speak' on this channel but everyone can see what's being
  discussed).

Please use only the language appropriate to the channel.  If you don't do
so, you'll be asked to change channels.  If you know of other non-English
channels, please tell us.

== Frugalware developers

If you're a Frugalware developer, please also join one or more of the 
non-developer channels.  Since users don't have the right to speak on the 
frugalware.dev channel, your presence on a non-developer channel is the only
way they can chat with you.

== Off-topic discussion

=== Other Linux distributions' features

You may talk discuss other distributions' features but don't expect to be
familiar with them. For example the following question:

  How can i set up my network so that it works as it does under Gentoo?

is impossible to answer for someone who hasn't used Gentoo.  Instead,
tell everyone what it is that you're trying to achieve, for example:

  Is it possible to use network profiles so that I can change all my settings
  with one command when i get home from my workplace?

=== Non-Frugalware discussion

Talking about non-Frugalware topics (or even non-Linux) is okay, as long as 
this doesn't prevent others from talking about Frugalware. We are a community,
so maybe you want to share other ideas, but don't make it impossible for others
to get help.

== Asking questions

=== I'm new to Frugalware

Welcome!  You probably have general questions, since you're about to install
Frugalware for the first time, but first you would like to get some of your
questions answered. No problem, but first please read the about page, you can
reach it here: http://frugalware.org/about

=== First read the Frugalware documentation

Before asking a question, first read the Frugalware documentation to be sure
that the answer is not already there.  Those who wrote the documentation have
spent quite an amount of time and effort.  If your question is answered in the
documentation you'll be told to read it and provided a link.  So please - read
the documentation and don't be lazy.

=== Don't ask if you can ask a question, just go ahead and ask

Go ahead and ask your question.  The worst that can happen is that you don't
get an answer.

== Paste

If you have a few lines of an error message or something similar to show to
others in the channel, don't paste it into the channel.  This is because:
# IRC is slow and,
# it breaks the flow of other peoples' conversations.

Instead, please use our Pastebin, which is available at
http://frugalware.org/paste.

== Is mxw_ a bot?

Yes, it is. It informs users about new binary packages, manages rights on the
channel and so on. If you want a new feature to be implemented then feel free
to request it at http://bugs.frugalware.org/.

== Bouncers, leaving your client online when you're away

That's not a problem, but please keep in mind the following: if you are away
then you should be able to read back the lines when you were highlighted.
If this is not possible then it's better to quit from the channels, since we
think that we're talking to you while we're talking with /dev/null. Also if
you're online and you have been highlighted and asked, please try to answer.
If you have no time, then a simple 

  alex: i don't have time atm to answer, sorry

is enough. So that he won't wait for your answer.

== Private messaging

Please do _not_ /msg users unless you asked about it and you're allowed.
This is a support channel: you ask in the channel and who have time / knowledge
to answer, he/she will. That the fastest way, believe us.

You should also know that some of us (voroskoi, vmiklos, maybe others too) set
up their clients to ignore msgs on freenode, so you talk to /dev/null when you
/msg to us.

== Logging

This is not a secret, the channel is logged and public, the logs are linked
from the homepage, and the main goal: Google searches in them. If you hate 
this, then the only choice is to not join ;-)
