= Mobile computers

== Battery

Notebook users are usually interested in the state of their battery. Usually
the following steps are required to enable this functionality:

Add the following two lines to your '/etc/sysconfig/modules':

-------
battery
ac
-------

The next task is to enable the acpid service:

`service acpid add`

Then the easiest way is to reboot, or if you don't want do do so:

--------------------
modprobe battery
modprobe ac
service hald stop
service dbus stop
service acpid start
service dbus start
service hald start
--------------------

The only remaining task is to start a client: if you're on console, try the
'acpi' command, or the relevant applet of your favorite window manager.

== Hibernation

Hibernating your computer can cause data loss or severe filesystem damage
if things go wrong. It's highly advised that first, you should consider if
hibernating is worth the effort at all. Try it on a fresh installation first,
instead of a production system.

From kernel/suspend.c:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* BIG FAT WARNING *********************************************************
*
* If you have unsupported (*) devices using DMA...
*                              ...say goodbye to your data.
*
* If you touch anything on disk between suspend and resume...
*                              ...kiss your data goodbye.
*
* If your disk driver does not support suspend... (IDE does)
*                              ...you'd better find out how to get along
*                                 without your data.
*
* If you change kernel command line between suspend and resume...
*                              ...prepare for nasty fsck or worse.
*
* If you change your hardware while system is suspended...
*                              ...well, it was not good idea.
*
* (*) suspend/resume support is needed to make it safe.

You have been warned. If you are still not discouraged, read on!

First, you need to create a swap partition (if you don't have any yet).
You have to add an extra resume=/dev/swappart kernel parameter to
'/boot/grub/menu.lst'. For example, on my machine the old line was:

`kernel (hd0,2)/boot/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda3 quiet vga=788`

The new line:

`kernel (hd0,2)/boot/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/hda3 quiet vga=788 resume=/dev/hda2`

After the above are done, you must reboot. The hibernation can be started with:

`echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk; echo disk > /sys/power/state`

and next time you boot your kernel it should resume. For more info, look at
'/usr/src/linux/Documentation/power/swsusp.txt'.  It requires the kernel documentation,
which can be installed issuing the `pacman-g2 -S kernel-docs` command as root.
