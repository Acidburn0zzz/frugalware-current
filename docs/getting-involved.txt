= This is a small tutorial for those who want to contribute to Frugalware

== Ways of contributing

There are many different ways to contribute to Frugalware. You can write
documentation, translate the existing ones to your native language (or
any other language you want to) maintain packages or making them better
whith adding features whatever.

If you are a programmer you can help us in developing our applications.
These are: pacman-g2, gfpm, fwlive, frugalwareutils, setup etc. See
http://darcs.frugalware.org[darcs.frugalware.org] for different project
repositories.

You can also start new projects. If you show some code we can surely host
your project too if it's frugalware related. For example you want to write
kfpm :)

IMPORTANT: After each title in brackets you can find the target audience.

=== Translations (translators)

You can read the details on our link:translations.html[Translations]
documentation page.

=== Necessary documentation (packagers, coders)

In the first part i will cover the necessary informations for those who
do _not_ have developer status yet.

In the second part we will set up the necessary config files.

First of all, we ask you to read the following documentations carefully.
If you do not want to deal with packages, just want to code it's usually
enough to read the darcs documentation as we store our code in darcs
repositories.

* man makepkg
* man pacman-g2
* man repoman
* man FrugalBuild
* man fwmakepkg
* http://frugalware.org/docs/makepkg[makepkg howto]
* http://www.darcs.net/manual/node4.html[darcs getting started]

I know, it is boring reading documentation, but you have to know that
writing them is even worse so do not ask questions when there is the
answer in the documentation. If you can not understand something
feel free to join #frugalware@irc.freenode.net and ask.

=== Downloading and setting up the repositories

==== Getting the frugalware-current repo (packagers)

The frugalware-current repo is the development repo for the packages.

When you want to get it you need the darcs package. Let's get it:
--------------------
$ pacman-g2 -S darcs
--------------------

Now create a darcs directory where you can hold all your repos. You can
choose any other name of course.
------------------
$ mkdir -p ~/darcs
$ cd ~/darcs
------------------

Now get the repo with darcs:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ darcs get --partial http://ftp5.frugalware.org/packages/frugalware/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current current
$ cd current
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now be patient while darcs gets all the patches and then applies them. You
may wonder what is the '--partial' option for. When you use --partial darcs
will not get all the patches, just the ones applyied after the last checkout.
It makes this procedure lot faster. Also you can use other mirrors as well.

==== Getting pacman-g2 and other code (coders)

First of all you need the repo of the program. In this example i will use
pacman-g2, but the steps are very similar.
NOTE: Most of our programs need the translations repo to compile)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir -p ~/darcs
$ cd ~/darcs
$ darcs get http://darcs.frugalware.org/repos/translations (optional)
$ darcs get http://darcs.frugalware.org/repos/pacman-g2
$ cd pacman-g2
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Setting up the repository and sending patch via email (packagers, coders)

Now you should add yourself as an author, otherwise darcs will ask for your
name all the time.
--------------------------------------------------------
$ echo 'yourname <email@addr.ess>' > _darcs/prefs/author
--------------------------------------------------------

Now you can make your changes. When finished run

------------
$ darcs what
------------

in the repository.

TIP: You can also use 'darcs what .' (note the dot in the end). In
that case darcs will show the changes recursively in the current directory.
It is very handy when you have lot of unrecorded canges in your repo.

If you satisfied with the changes run

--------------
$ darcs record
--------------

to record the changes. Whithout recording the patch you can not send nor
push (just developers) it.

TIP: Whith frugalware-* repos it's recommended to use 'repoman rec'
which is a wrapper for darcs record. It sets up the patch name properly
so you only need to deal with the details.

Here comes the final step. Send in the patch!

------------
$ darcs send
------------

If everything goes fine your patch should show up on
http://frugalware.org/mailman/listinfo/frugalware-devel[frugalware-devel]
mailing list soon.

NOTE: You have to subscribe to
http://frugalware.org/mailman/listinfo/frugalware-devel[frugalware-devel]
mailing list and set up your SMTP server properly.

=== Further options for those who have developer account (packagers, coders)

Once you get a developer account, you have the right to request the
following services:

* BTS access (so that we can assign tasks to you)
* darcs write access (you'll always get this, except if you are working
on the artwork or so)
* voice on the #frugalware.dev channel
* a @frugalware.org mail address (with imaps/pop3s access)

What you should do:

* You should read the frugalware-devel mailing list. When you're asked,
please try to respond.
* If you push patches to darcs, you should subscribe to the
frugalware-darcs mailing list. This is list has a big traffic since a
new mail is sent for each patch. If you don't have time to read it,
subscribe then set the "I would like to reveive no mail" option.
Also take care that your subscribing email equals to the one you set in
darcs/prefs/author
* Also it's good if you can join the user and developer channel when you're
online.

Let us see what you should set up to get it work. I will also give some tips
which can make your life easier.

As you will use darcs almost all the time it is a good idea to set up an alias.
------------------------------------------
$ echo 'alias dr=darcs' >> ~/.bash_profile
------------------------------------------

You should also note that darcs automatically completes its commands, so from
now 'darcs whatsnew' and 'dr what' does exactly the same.

==== Setting up the frugalware-* repos and repoman (packagers)

It is time to set up some necessary things. We start with the frugalware-current
repo. Make sure that you are in the root of the frugalware-current repo. Also
do not forget to change the username to your login name on darcs.frugalware.org.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ echo 'username@darcs.frugalware.org:/home/ftp/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current' > _darcs/prefs/defaultrepo
$ echo 'push apply-as vmiklos' >> _darcs/prefs/defaults
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Do not edit the second line! So that vmiklos have to be vmiklos. It's because the
permissions on the server.

As you will use repoman to upload the fpms (and many other things as you'll see)
we should set it up now. This step is also necessary. Open '~/.repoman.conf' with
your favourite editor and add the following lines:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fst_root=~/darcs
current_servers=("username@darcs.frugalware.org:/home/ftp/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current")
stable_servers=("username@darcs.frugalware.org:/home/ftp/pub/frugalware/frugalware-stable")
stable_pushonly="y"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where fst_root is the directory where you store your darcs repos. Username
is your login on darcs.frugalware.org. For details see man repoman.

As from now use the following command from package's directory to push
your changes.

--------------
$ repoman push
--------------

It will check the FrugalBuild using fblint, then records your changes,
pushes them, uploads the fpms and finally creates the changelog, updates
the fdb etc. So you are done if there was no error message.

==== Setting up other repos (coders)

In repo's main directory:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ echo 'username@darcs.frugalware.org:/home/ftp/pub/other/pacman-g2/pacman-g2' > _darcs/prefs/defaultrepo
$ echo 'push apply-as vmiklos' >> _darcs/prefs/defaults
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not forget to change the username and repository path.
For paths refer to http://wiki.frugalware.org/Repos[Repos] page in wiki.

IMPORTANT: Do not edit the second line! So that vmiklos have to be vmiklos. It's because the
permissions on the server.

From now you should use

------------
$ darcs push
------------

to send in your changes.
