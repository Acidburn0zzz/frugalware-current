Handling security bugs
======================

1) The security team opens a new task in the BTS, with a [SEC] prefix.

2) The maintainer fixes the issue in -current and decides if the issue needs
fixing in -stable or not. If yes, then changes the status of the task to "Fixed
in -current", otherwise closes the task.

4) If there is no patch for the issue yet, then set the status to
"Researching". This indicates that you, the maintainer knows the problem, just
you don't have enough resources to fix it.

3) The security team regularly searches for "Fixed in -current" bugs, fixes the issue in -stable and releases a new FSA.

How to release an FSA?
======================

1) Check if the backport is ready (the binary packages should be uploaded for
each arch).

2) Update the frugalware/xml/security.xml file and check if the mail is sent to
the frugalware-security list. If not, then ask on -devel what can be the
problem.
