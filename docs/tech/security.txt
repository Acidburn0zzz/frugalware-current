Handling security bugs
======================

Currently it's just a plan and not too complex, but it's good to write it down
to somehere.

1) The security team opens a new task in the BTS, with a [SEC] prefix.

2) The maintainer fixes the issue in -current and decides if the issue needs
fixing in -stable or not. If yes, then changes the status of the task to "Fixed
in -current", otherwise closes the task.

3) The security team regularly searches for "Fixed in -current" bugs, fixes the issue in -stable and releases a new FSA.

How to release an FSA?
======================

1) Check if the backport is ready (the binary packages should be uploaded for
each arch).

2) FIXME: updating the XML.
