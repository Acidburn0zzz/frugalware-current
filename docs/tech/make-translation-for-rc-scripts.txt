The first things to make a script translatable you must add this two lines to
the rc script.

TEXTDOMAIN=my_service
TEXTDOMAINDIR=/lib/initscripts/messages

If you source /lib/initscripts/functions you doesn't need the second line.

To mark a string as translatable you must prefix the string with $.

    echo $"This is a translatable string."

After this you must create the pot file.

    $ bash --dump-po-strings rc.my_service | xgettext -L PO -o my_service.pot -

In the next step you create the po file.

   $ msginit -l hu_HU

Now you can edit the po file with any editor.

To create and install the mo files, you must add this lines to your FrugalBuild.

    Fmkdir /lib/initscripts/messages/hu/LC_MESSAGES
    msgfmt -o $Fdestdir/lib/initscripts/messages/hu/LC_MESSAGES/my_service.mo \
              $Fsrcdir/hu.po

I really hope this system will work. But this I will know after I have ported
something. :)
