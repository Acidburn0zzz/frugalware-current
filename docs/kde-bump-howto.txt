= KDE4 Bump HOWTO


You *MUST* follow this HOWTO when bumping KDE4 to a new version (even a minor version).

First, update KDE4 version (_F_kde_ver) in source/include/kde.sh. 
Commit this (git commit kde.sh). 

Next, packages must be compiled in the order listed below (if you find a
change that needs to be made to this list, poke the kde m8r). 
You can generally find the sha1sums in the kde website (somewhere like http://kde.org/info/[KdeVersion].php). 
If it is a major bump (i.e. 4.6 to 4.7) it is wise to check the updated build 
instructions on the Kde website, and work in a kde testing repo first. 


'KDE4 compile order'

- kdelibs (1)
- kdepimlibs (1)
- kdebase (1)
- kdebase-runtime (1)
- kdebase-workspace (1)

- kdenetwork
- kdegraphics
- kdemultimedia
- kdesdk (-extra)
- kdewebdev (-extra)
- kdeedu (-extra)
- kdebindings
- kdeadmin
- kdeutils
- kdeplasma-addons
- kdeaccessibility (-extra)
- kdeartwork (-extra)
- kdetoys (-extra)
- kdegames

- kde-l10n (2)
- oxygen-icons (3)


(1) = these 5 packages *MUST* be built first, and in *THIS* order. 
(-extra) = kde-extra packages. Some are needed as makedepends for other packages. 
(2) kde-l10n is usually built last. 
(3) oxygen-icons can be updated at anytime.
