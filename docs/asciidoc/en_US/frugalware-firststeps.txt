= First steps

== How to contribute

If you find our work and effort worth it, please consider donating.
 This is not limited to monetary contributions, every donation of a
 limited valuable resource (including your time, knowledge) is appreciated.
 Depending on your resources, there are many ways to help us.

=== Translation

A comprehensive and multi-language documentation is very important.
 With linguistic and no programming knowledge and some time, you can
 help us create (by asking) and maintain different translations.

=== Application packaging

In the http://bugs.frugalware.org[Bug Tracking System], there are
feature requests for some packages. The process of making packages is
well documented, and with some GNU/Linux experience, it isn't difficult.
But it takes time, so submitting well-packaged software is a great way
to help us and save our time.

=== Developing

Of course, any skilled help is appreciated in developing core systems, like
contributing code to pacman or the setup.

=== Donating hardware

By sending us some wanted hardware (see http://frugalware.org/donations[donations]),
you can make testing packages easier, or speed up the package creation
process within a specific sub-architecture.
