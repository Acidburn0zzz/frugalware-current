=== About Frugalware

[Eric S. Raymond]
_______________________________________________________________________________
Seeing this feast of wonderful code spread in front of me as a working
system was a much more powerful experience than merely knowing, intellectually,
that all the bits were probably out there. It was as though for years I'd been
sorting through piles of disconnected car parts - only to be suddenly
confronted with those same parts assembled into a gleaming red Ferrari,
door open, keys swinging from the lock and engine gently purring with
a promise of power...

The aim of creating Frugalware was to help you doing your work faster
and simpler. We hope you will like it. In this introduction,
we would like to answer two questions which were asked in an interview with
VMiklos, the founder of the project at the Hungarian Unix Portal website.
If you understand Hungarian, you can read the full interview at
http://www.hup.hu/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=7264[HUP].

'Why have I decided to start the Frugalware project? What has inspired
you developing Frugalware? Displeasure with the current distributions
or  world domination plans?'

``Probably the previous :-) From the Slackware-Redhat-Debian trio, I was the
most pleased with Slackware, but it has some serious imperfections as well:
for example the slow package manager, the absence of support for languages
other than English and the lack of automatic package update (AFAIK, this
problem has been already resolved with slapt-get).''

'Why Frugalware isn't just another distro? In what aspects doesFrugalware
differ from other distributions? Why should someone choose it?'

``We are trying to drop nothing from Slackware's advantages (simplicity, speed,
etc). But we have solved the three - probably most important - problems
mentioned above. Besides, lots of small fixes and improvements have been made,
like the support and optional use of ivman, or the installation of some nice
fonts by default.''

=== Quick reference

* Package management: pacman-g2 (cli)
* No PAM (a'la Slackware)
* i686 or later CPU needed on x86
* Supported architectures: i686, x86_64, PPC port is started
* linux kernel 2.6 (no 2.4 support)
* the latest documentation is http://frugalware.org/docs.php[here].

=== How to contribute

If you find our work and effort worth it, please consider donating.
 This is not limited to monetary contributions, every donation of a
 limited valuable resource (including your time, knowledge) is appreciated.
 Depending on your resources, there are many ways to help us.

==== Translation

A comprehensive and multi-language documentation is very important.
 With linguistic and no programming knowledge and some time, you can
 help us create (by asking) and maintain different translations.

==== Application packaging

In the http://bugs.frugalware.org[Bug Tracking System], there are
feature requests for some packages. The process of making packages is
well documented, and with some GNU/Linux experience, it isn't difficult.
But it takes time, so submitting well-packaged software is a great way
to help us and save our time.

==== Developing

Of course, any skilled help is appreciated in developing core systems, like
contributing code to pacman or the setup.

==== Donating hardware

By sending us some wanted hardware (see http://frugalware.org/donations.php[donations]),
you can make testing packages easier, or speed up the package creation
process within a specific sub-architecture.

==== Monetary contributions

Of course, you can send money as well, this enables us to buy hardware,
raw media to write Frugalware on, and the like.

FIXME Address the money can be sent to, methods etc
