= Security support

== Introduction

This document documents the work of the Frugalware Security Team. Primarily
it's for new developers or for existing developers who started to work in the
Security Team.

== Handling security bugs

. The security team opens a new task in the BTS, with a [SEC] prefix.

. The maintainer fixes the issue in -current and decides if the issue needs
fixing in -stable or not. If yes, then changes the status of the task to "Fixed
in -current", otherwise closes the task.

. If there is no patch for the issue yet, then set the status to "Researching".
This indicates that you, the maintainer knows the problem, just you don't have
enough resources to fix it.

. The security team regularly searches for "Fixed in -current" bugs, fixes the
issue in -stable and releases a new FSA.

== How to release an FSA?

. Check if the backport is ready (the binary packages should be uploaded for
each arch).

. Update the frugalware/xml/security.xml file in the homepage-ng repo and check
if the mail is sent to the frugalware-security list. If not, then ask on -devel
what can be the problem.

== How to notice security issues

. Subscribe to Secunia Security Advisories List at
http://secunia.com/secunia_security_advisories/ page.  This is the best place
to notice issues.
. Read the mails one-by-one and check if the advisory affects -current or
-stable.
. Open a task in BTS if necessary. Please fill in the form correctly, provide a
patch if you can.

You can also read other mailing list, like
https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure, but secunia
monitors them, so you won't miss anything. (You just notice things later.)

== How to get patches

Secunia announces sec issues days after they released so there is a good chance to find a patch.

. First of all sometimes upstream fixes it with a new version.
. Fixed in cvs/svn/whatever and you are able to find the patch (unlike PHP)
. If these two fails, there is http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool. Secunia
also mails you if the bug fixen in ubuntu, so steal the patch from them :) You
only need the $package-$pkgver.diff.gz. There is a changelog in it, where you
can find the filename of the fix.
. It's also a good idea to take a look on redhat/gentoo bugzilla. They attach fixes most the time.

So it's good to read the secunia mails carefully as you'll always know when the patch is available.
