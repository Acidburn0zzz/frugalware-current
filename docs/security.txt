= Security support

== Introduction

This document documents the work of the Frugalware Security Team. Primarily
it's for new developers or for existing developers who started to work in the
Security Team.

== Handling security bugs

. The security team opens a new task in the BTS, with a [SEC] prefix.

. The maintainer fixes the issue in -current and decides if the issue needs
fixing in -stable or not. If yes, then changes the status of the task to "Fixed
in -current", otherwise closes the task.

. If there is no patch for the issue yet, then set the status to "Researching".
This indicates that you, the maintainer knows the problem, just you don't have
enough resources to fix it.

. The security team regularly searches for "Fixed in -current" bugs, fixes the
issue in -stable and releases a new FSA.

== How to release an FSA?

. Check if the backport is ready (the binary packages should be uploaded for
each arch).

. Update the frugalware/xml/security.xml file in the homepage-ng repo and check
if the mail is sent to the frugalware-security list. If not, then ask on -devel
what can be the problem.

== How to notice security issues

. Subscribe to Secunia Security Advisories List at
http://secunia.com/secunia_security_advisories/ page.  This is the best place
to notice issues.
. Read the mails one-by-one and check if the advisory affects -current or
-stable.
. Open a task in BTS if necessary. Please fill in the form correctly, provide a
patch if you can.

You can also read other mailing list, like
https://lists.grok.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/full-disclosure, but secunia
monitors them, so you won't miss anything. (You just notice things later.)

== How to get patches

Secunia announces sec issues days after they released so there is a good chance to find a patch.

. First of all sometimes upstream fixes it with a new version.
. Fixed in cvs/svn/whatever and you are able to find the patch (unlike PHP)
. If these two fails, there is http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool. Secunia
also mails you if the bug fixen in ubuntu, so steal the patch from them :) You
only need the $package-$pkgver.diff.gz. There is a changelog in it, where you
can find the filename of the fix.
. It's also a good idea to take a look on redhat/gentoo bugzilla. They attach fixes most the time.

So it's good to read the secunia mails carefully as you'll always know when the patch is available.

== Versioning

We use integers in pkgrels for normal packages, but -stable updates are
different. Here are the cases:

* If you do a version bump (we refer to them as 'secfix bump' usually in
  -stable commit messages), then you need to set pkgrel to 1kalgan1.

* If you add a security patch, and pkgrel was an integer (let's say '1'), then
  you should increment pkgrel to 2kalgan1.

* If you add a security patch when the pkgrel was already in an XkalganY form,
  increment it to XkalganY+1. (Alternatively, you can use X+1kalganY if there
  is already a newer version in -current.)

(Replace kalgan with the current release name, later.)

This ensures the followings:

* The version of the security update will be larger than the one in -stable, so
  that the package will be upgraded when the user does a pacman-g2 -Syu on
  -stable.
* The version of the security update will be smaller than the one in -current,
  so that the package will be upgraded when the user upgrades to a new version
  (current or new stable).
