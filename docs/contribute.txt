= How to contribute

If you find our work and effort worth it, please consider donating.
 This is not limited to monetary contributions, every donation of a
 limited valuable resource (including your time, knowledge) is appreciated.
 Depending on your resources, there are many ways to help us.

== Translation

A comprehensive and multi-language documentation is very important.
 With linguistic and no programming knowledge and some time, you can
 help us create (by asking) and maintain different translations.

== Application packaging

In the http://bugs.frugalware.org[Bug Tracking System], there are
feature requests for some packages. The process of making packages is
well documented, and with some GNU/Linux experience, it isn't difficult.
But it takes time, so submitting well-packaged software is a great way
to help us and save our time.

== Developing

Of course, any skilled help is appreciated in developing core systems, like
contributing code to pacman-g2 or the setup.

== Donating hardware

By sending us some wanted hardware (see http://frugalware.org/donations[donations]),
you can make testing packages easier, or speed up the package creation
process within a specific architecture.

== Artwork

We usually update our artwork (background images, grub splash, desktop manager
themes, window manager splashes and so on) for each release. If you are skilled
to help, you're welcome. :)

== Support

If you have time and knowledge, monitor the forums, read the mailing list
posts, hang around on IRC and try to answer the questions, solve the occured
problems.

== Find bugs

If you find bugs, you can help with submitting well-written bugreports, see the
Reporting Bugs section for more info.
