= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.4 to 1.5

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.4
(Nexon) system to Frugalware-1.5 (Mores).

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is
to install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

== systemd

The default init system is systemd on new installs. You need to manually
replace it when you upgrade:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy systemd
----

//== Removing obsolete packages

//Some software has been marked as obsolete in the new release. To remove
//them:

//----
//# pacman-g2 -Rd gvfs-gconf
//----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
# find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
