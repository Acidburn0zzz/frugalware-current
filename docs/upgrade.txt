= Upgrading from Frugalware 0.8 to 0.9

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-0.8
(Kalgan) system to Frugalware-0.9 (Solaria).

== pacman-g2

Solaria comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is to
install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

NOTE: Don't worry, this will upgrade other core packages like glibc and
libarchive, too. This is expected.

== Removing obsolete packages

Some software has been marked as obsolete in Solaria. To remove them:

----
# pacman-g2 -R galago-sharp
----

NOTE: Of course if you don't have these packages (which is not the default) you
can skip this step.

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
----

You will be asked to replace and/or remove a few packages automatically.
These are normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions
(or just hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while :-)

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine again.

Done!
