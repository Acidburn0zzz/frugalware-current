= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.0 to 1.1

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.1
(Anacreon) system to Frugalware-1.1 (Getorin).

== pacman-g2

Getorin comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is to
install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

== Removing obsolete packages

Some software has been marked as obsolete in Getorin. To remove them:

----
# pacman-g2 -Rd pygobject-gvfs gst-plugins-bad-x264
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
:: Replace frugalrledit with frugalware/gservice? [Y/n]
:: Replace icu with frugalware/icu4c? [Y/n]
:: Replace xphelloworld with frugalware/libxprintutil? [Y/n]
:: Replace xf86-video-vermilion with frugalware/xf86-video-vesa? [Y/n]
:: Replace xf86-video-imstt with frugalware/xf86-video-vesa? [Y/n]
:: Replace gfpm-mcs-plugin with frugalware/xfce4-gfpm-plugin? [Y/n]
:: Replace gnetconfig-mcs-plugin with frugalware/xfce4-gnetconfig-plugin? [Y/n]
:: Replace xfce4-screenshooter-plugin with frugalware/xfce4-screenshooter? [Y/n]
:: Replace xfce-mcs-manager with frugalware/xfce4-settings? [Y/n]
:: Replace xfce-mcs-plugins with frugalware/xfce4-settings? [Y/n]
:: Replace libxfce4mcs with frugalware/xfconf? [Y/n]
resolving dependencies... done.
----

You will be asked to replace the above packages automatically.  These
are normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or
just hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Installing replacement packages

In case you removed anything in section 3, now you can install the
replacement packages:

----
# pacman-g2 -S gst-plugins-ugly-x264
----

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
