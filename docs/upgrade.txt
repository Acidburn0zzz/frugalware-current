= Upgrading from Frugalware 0.9 to 1.0

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-0.9
(Solaria) system to Frugalware-1.0 (Anacreon).

== pacman-g2

Anacreon comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is to
install it along with the updated libarchive:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy libarchive pacman-g2
-----

NOTE: Don't worry, this will upgrade other core packages like lzma, too.
This is expected.

== Removing obsolete packages

Some software has been marked as obsolete in Anacreon. To remove them:

----
# pacman-g2 -R gst-plugins-good-cdio
----

NOTE: Of course if you don't have these packages (which is not the default) you
can skip this step.

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
:: Replace frugalrledit with frugalware-current/gservice? [Y/n]
:: Replace device-mapper with frugalware-current/lvm2? [Y/n]
:: Replace pwlib with frugalware-current/ptlib? [Y/n]
resolving dependencies... done.
----

You will be asked to replace the above packages automatically.  These
are normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or
just hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while :-)

== Installing replacement packages

In case you removed anything in section 3, now you can install the
replacement packages:

----
# pacman-g2 -S gst-plugins-ugly-cdio
----

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
