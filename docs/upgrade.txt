= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.3 to 1.4

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.3
(Haven) system to Frugalware-1.3 (Nexon).

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is
to install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

== Removing obsolete packages

Some software has been marked as obsolete in the new release. To remove
them:

----
# pacman-g2 -Rd gvfs-gconf
----

The LIRC kernel driver is not part of the default install, but in case
you had it installed, that's now part of the stock kernel, so remove the
separate package:

----
# pacman-g2 -Rd lirc_modules
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
# find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
