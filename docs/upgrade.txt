= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.1 to 1.2

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.1
(Getorin) system to Frugalware-1.2 (Locris).

== pacman-g2

Locris comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is to
install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

//== Removing obsolete packages
//
//Some software has been marked as obsolete in Getorin. To remove them:
//
//----
//# pacman-g2 -Rd pygobject-gvfs gst-plugins-bad-x264
//----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
----

//You will be asked to replace the above packages automatically.  These
//are normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or
//just hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

//== Installing replacement packages
//
//In case you removed anything in section 3, now you can install the
//replacement packages:
//
//----
//# pacman-g2 -S gst-plugins-ugly-x264
//----

== Kernel-Mode Setting

If you are not using an Intel or a Radeon video card (kernel module
names: i915 and readeon), then just skip this section.

KMS is enabled by default in Locris for Intel and Radeon cards.

KMS stands for Kernel-Mode Setting, more
http://kerneltrap.org/node/8242[here].

If you upgrade and you just reboot, you will have a blank framebuffer,
but once X comes up, you will have a working system. To avoid this
situation you have to edit your `/boot/grub/menu.lst` and remove the
`vga=791` (or similar) kernel parameter from the kernel command line.
That way you will have a similar framebuffer as before.

If you did not have a `vga=` line before (because you manually removed
it) and now you are angry about having a framebuffer, you can add
`i915.modeset=0` to the kernel command line and you will no longer have
a framebuffer.

== UDev config files

We used to have all rules under `/etc/udev/rules.d`, but nowadays only
the configfile-like rules (network interface naming, etc) ones are
there, the rest lives under `/lib/udev/rules.d`. Because of this, we
moved the `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules` file to
`/lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules`. It's possible that the old
`/etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules` file is still there, if you have drm
problems, please check if you need to remove it.

== KDE 4.x upgrade

KDE has been upgraded from the old 3.x series to the new 4.x one. This
is a major change, multiple parts of the Software Compilation has been
completely rewritten, and as a result, sometimes the old configuration
files are not parsed completely. So be warned, it's expected that you
need to re-configure a few of your favorite KDE applications before they
are ready to work again.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
