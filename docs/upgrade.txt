= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.8 to 1.9

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.8
(Cinna) system to Frugalware-1.9 (Arcturus).

== Deprecated package removal

Some packages will not gracefully be removed because of strict dependencies.
Here is the command to remove them before an upgrade:

----
pacman-g2 -Rd
----

If you get an error for a particular package, then remove it from the list
and try again. This list contains packages you may not have installed.

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved `pacman-g2`, you should install it
first:

----
pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== default console font change
We have changed the default console font. If you wish to change yours to
match our new default, edit `/etc/vconsole.conf` and change or add the
`FONT` line to read this:

----
FONT=ter-v16b
----

== 10-evdev.conf
We have removed usage of `10-evdev.conf`, as we are moving to how systemd
handles XKB configuration. To upgrade to this method, check the contents of
`/etc/vconsole.conf` for your current `KEYMAP`. Now, run this command:

----
localectl set-keymap KEYMAP
----

Replace `KEYMAP` with your preferred keymap, and it will propagate this change
to your vconsole and XKB configuration files. Once done, remove the old file:

----
rm -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf
----

Some users have reported that the new XKB file has not been written by the first
usage of locatlectl. If this happens to you, then the only known solution is to
try something like this:

----
localectl set-keymap us
localectl set-keymap KEYMAP
----

== xorg-set-resolution
This is a new service which sets your default X resolution to match your
kernel framebuffer resolution, if you are using a custom one via the `video`
boot parameter. If this is not something you want, you can disable it via this
command:

----
systemctl disable xorg-set-resolution.service
----

== PRETTY_HOSTNAME
New installs now setup the `PRETTY_HOSTNAME` in addition to the `HOSTNAME`. If you
wish to do this as well, use `hostconfig` from `fvbeutils`.

== systemd default boot mode
New installs now setup the default systemd boot target. If you wish to do this as
well, use `modeconfig` from `fvbeutils`.

== network interface changes
New `systemd` now changes network interface names from `eth0` and such to something
that is more consistent across reboots. As such, you will need to update any services
you have configured to use interface names, to use their new form.

== netconfig removal
Our old `netconfig` system has finally been removed. We are now using `NetworkManager`
as our default network configuration system. To ease the transition, we recommend
using the new `nmconfig` from `fvbeutils`. It provides a simple profile editor for
`NetworkManager`. It should be compatible with the profiles generated by the GUI
editors for `NetworkManager`. If you need to be able to perform `NetworkManager`
commands, such as changing the active network profile, from a terminal then see
the man page for `nmcli`.

== vi symlink removal
There is no longer a symlink provided with our packages for `/bin/vi` and
`/usr/bin/vi`. It is recommend that you run the `viconfig` tool in order to
select a new editor for these symlinks. It will also set the default value
for `EDITOR` and `VISUAL` environmental variables.

== /etc/sysconfig/desktop removal
The old system for managing display managers is now fully deprecated. It will be
removed after this release cycle, so you should transition to the new system. This
can be done by running the `dmconfig` tool from `fvbeutils`, or by manually enabling
the appropriate `systemd` service. For example, `kdm.service` for `kdm`.

== lesspipe
This package now supports source highlighting by default if `source-highlight`
is installed. If this is not something you want, you can disable it by editting
`/etc/profile` and removing `-R` from the `LESS` environmental variable.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
