= Upgrading from Frugalware 0.7 to 0.8

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-0.7
(Sayshell) system to Frugalware-0.8 (Kalgan).

== pacman-g2

Kalgan comes with an improved (both in features and in speed) pacman-g2,
so the first step is to install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

NOTE: Don't worry, this will upgrade glibc, too. This is expected.

== Removing obsolete packages

Some software has been marked as obsolete in Kalgan. To remove them:

----
# pacman-g2 -Rd gst-plugins-bad-nas gst-plugins-bad-opengl
----

NOTE: Of course if you don't have these packages (which is not the default) you
can skip this step.

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
----

You will be asked to replace and/or remove a few packages automatically.
The following ones are normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to
these questions (or just hit ENTER):

----
:: Starting local database upgrade...
:: Replace frugalpkg with frugalware/gfpm? [Y/n]
:: Replace perl-xml with frugalware/perl-xml-parser? [Y/n]
:: Replace xf86-video-i810 with frugalware/xf86-video-intel? [Y/n]
:: Replace xespgs with frugalware/xghostscript? [Y/n]
resolving dependencies... done.
looking for inter-conflicts (750/750)             [#######################] 100%
:: perl conflicts with perl-io-zlib. Remove perl-io-zlib? [Y/n]
:: perl conflicts with perl-io-compress-zlib. Remove perl-io-compress-zlib? [Y/n]
:: perl conflicts with perl-io-compress-base. Remove perl-io-compress-base? [Y/n]
:: perl conflicts with perl-extutils-cbuilder. Remove perl-extutils-cbuilder? [Y/n]
:: perl conflicts with perl-compress-zlib. Remove perl-compress-zlib? [Y/n]
:: perl conflicts with perl-compress-raw-zlib. Remove perl-compress-raw-zlib? [Y/n]
----

After this the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit enter and
wait. Make some tea, it can take a while :-)

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine again.

Done!
