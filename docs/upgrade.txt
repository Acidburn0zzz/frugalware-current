= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.1 to 1.2

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.2
(Locris) system to Frugalware-1.3 (Haven).

== pacman-g2

Locris comes with an improved pacman-g2, so the first step is to
install it:

----
# pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
-----

== Removing obsolete packages

Some software has been marked as obsolete in Getorin. To remove them:

----
# pacman-g2 -Rd pident ctorrent farsight gst-plugins-farsight libjingle-tapioca libchipcard2 libchipcard3 bitswash
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
# pacman-g2 -Su
FIXME - replaced pkg list
----

You will be asked to replace the above packages automatically.  These
are normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or
just hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Installing replacement packages

In case you removed anything in section 3, now you can install the
replacement packages:


=== ctorrent, bitswash ===

Those projects are abandoned. Just look for an other bittorrent client
in the tree. Those can be: rtorrent, deluge, btg, libtorrent-rasterbar
to mention some of them.

----
# pacman-g2 -S deluge
----

=== pident ===

No replacement for this package. You should not use it anyway.

=== farsight, gst-plugins-farsight, libjingle-tapioca ===

farsight2, gst-plugins-good and gst-plugins-bad are the replacements
here. Farsight2 will install the others as well.

----
# pacman-g2 -S farsight2
----

=== libchipcard2, libchipcard3 ===

These libraries are very old. None of your packages should depend on them,
so use libchipcard package instead of these.

//== KDE 4.x upgrade
//
//KDE has been upgraded from the old 3.x series to the new 4.x one. This
//is a major change, multiple parts of the Software Compilation has been
//completely rewritten, and as a result, sometimes the old configuration
//files are not parsed completely. So be warned, it's expected that you
//need to re-configure a few of your favorite KDE applications before they
//are ready to work again.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
