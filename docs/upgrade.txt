= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.8 to 1.9

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.8
(Cinna) system to Frugalware-1.9 (Arcturus).

== Deprecated package removal

Some packages will not gracefully be removed because of strict dependencies.
If you encounter a message such as this during a system upgrade:
----
:: foobar-subpkg: requires foobar=1.0.0
----
Then you will need to perform this command for each of the removed packages:
----
pacman-g2 -Rd <PACKAGES>
----
<PACKAGES> must be replaced by the names of each of the removed packages.
This must be done prior to the system upgrade.

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved `pacman-g2`, you should install it
first:

----
pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== vi symlink removal
There is no longer a symlink provided with our packages for `/bin/vi` and
`/usr/bin/vi`. It is recommend that you run the `viconfig` tool in order to
select a new editor for these symlinks. It will also set the default value
for `EDITOR` and `VISUAL` environmental variables.

== default console font change
We have changed the default console font. If you wish to change yours to
match our new default, edit `/etc/vconsole.conf` and change or add the
`FONT` line to read this:

----
FONT=ter-v16b
----

== 10-evdev.conf
We have removed the usage of `10-evdev.conf`, as we are moving to how systemd
handles XKB configuration. It is recommended that you run the `kbconfig` tool
in order to select a new vconsole and XKB keymap. If you need to find your
existing keymap, check the contents of `/etc/vconsole.conf` for your current
`KEYMAP`.

When you are finished, remove the old `10-evdev.conf` file.

----
rm -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf
----

== xorg-set-resolution
This is a new service which sets your default X resolution to match your
kernel framebuffer resolution, if you are using a custom one via the `video`
boot parameter. If this is not something you want, you can disable it via this
command:

----
systemctl disable xorg-set-resolution.service
----

== PRETTY_HOSTNAME
New installs now setup the `PRETTY_HOSTNAME` in addition to the `HOSTNAME`. If you
wish to do this as well, use `hostconfig` from `fvbeutils`.

== systemd default display manager
New installs now setup the default display manager using the new system of having
a unique systemd service for each display manager. To upgrade to this new behavior,
you must first disable the old display manager service like so:

----
systemctl disable display-manager-legacy.service
----

To enable a display manager using the new system, you can simply run the `dmconfig`
tool from `fvbeutils`. If you prefer to do this directly, you can instead do it like
so, assuming that `lightdm` is your preference:

----
systemctl enable lightdm.service
----

If you wish to use a different display manager, then replace the `lightdm.service`
with the appropriate systemd service name for your display manager of choice.

Finally, delete the old display manager configuration file as shown below:

----
rm -f /etc/sysconfig/desktop
----

== network interface changes
New `systemd` now changes network interface names from `eth0` and such to something
that is more consistent across reboots. As such, you will need to update any services
you have configured to use interface names, to use their new form.

== netconfig removal
Our old `netconfig` system has finally been removed. We are now using `NetworkManager`
as our default network configuration system. To ease the transition, we recommend
using the new `nmconfig` from `fvbeutils`. It provides a simple profile editor for
`NetworkManager`. It should be compatible with the profiles generated by the GUI
editors for `NetworkManager`. If you need to be able to perform `NetworkManager`
commands, such as changing the active network profile, from a terminal then see
the man page for `nmcli`.

== lesspipe
This package now supports source highlighting by default if `source-highlight`
is installed. If this is not something you want, you can disable it by editting
`/etc/profile` and removing `-R` from the `LESS` environmental variable.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
