\chapter{Installation Guide for Frugalware Linux}
\section{Obtaining a source media}

A Frugalware installation media can be obtained from several sources. You can freely download it via http, ftp or rsync or you can buy a CD at CheapISO.com (see \url{http://cheapiso.com/product\_info.php?products\_id=141}).

Here are some examples:

Via http: {\tt wget http://ftp4.frugalware.org/pub/linux/distributions/frugalware/frugalware-\textit{version}-iso/frugalware-\textit{version}-cd\textit{n}.iso}

Via ftp: {\tt wget ftp://ftp2.frugalware.org/frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-\textit{version}-iso/frugalware-\textit{version}-cd\textit{n}.iso}

Via rsync: {\tt rsync -avP ftp.frugalware.org::ftp/pub/frugalwarefrugalware-\textit{version}-iso/frugalware-\textit{version}-cd\textit{n}.iso}

More info and the full list of mirrors can be found at our download page: \url{http://frugalware.org/download.php}.

What CDs do you need? If you install a server without X, only the first. If you don't need language packs, but the graphical system, then you'll need the first and the second CD. (The first two CD is recommended too, if you have Internet connection, but need language packs: You install Frugalware from those CDs, and then you install that one or two language packs you need from ftp servers.) If you don't have any Internet connection but you want langpacks and other optional packages, the you'll need all the three CDs.

\section{The installation process}

After downloading and burning the CDs/DVD, insert the first CD/DVD to your CD/DVD drive, and reboot your computer. In the grub menu, you can disable the framebuffer, if a framebuffer with resolution 800x600 is not suitable for your graphics card or monitor. After that, grub loads the kernel and the initrd image.

At the first dialog, you should select your language. If your language is not on the list, you should choose English. Now the setup greets you :-)

 After selecting your keyboard map in the next window, setup searches automatically for installation media.
 
 The next step is partitioning. Frugalware setup displays a list of your hard disks, and you should choose one of them to partition with a program. You can select the partitioning program in the next dialog, currently fdisk and cfdisk are supported. You should create at least one partition with type Linux, and recommended to create a swap partition (with type Linux swap). If you have finished partitioning, press Continue.
 
The following list displays your swap partitions, and here you can choose what swap partitions are allowed to use for Frugalware. Then setup formats your swap partitions.

In the next window, first you should select your root device. Then you can choose to format it or keep the existing filesystem on it. After selecting the root device, you can setup other Linux partitions: optionally formatting them, and setting their mount points. Using a separate partition for {\tt /boot} is supported, but for {\tt /usr}, currently \textit{not}.

After having your Linux partitions mounted, you should do the same with your dos/windows ones. Setup will display a list of them, if any exists. Here only you should simply choose a mount point for them.

The next step is to select package categories. Usually a full installation is the best choice, or if you will not use KDE or GNOME, you may probably disable them. In most cases, it's no good disabling other categories. The next window will display the packages which are included in the selected categories. Feel free to you and letter key to find a specific package. Simply hitting enter is usually enough here. 

After the base section, setup will install grub onto your hard disk. Here there are three options: installing to the MBR, root or floppy. Installing to MBR is the good choice, if you want Frugalware to manage your computer's booting. The root is a good idea, if you want to install grub into your root device, so grub will not modify your existing boot manager. Floppy is a good idea for example if you don't have any boot manager installed, but you want your MBR unmodified.

After installing grub, setup will continue to install other sections (app, lib, multimedia, network) from the first CD. If it has been done, you will have been prompted to insert Frugalware Install Disc 2. If you only have one disc, feel free to abort installing packages. Then skip to section \ref{section:baseconfig}. After setup finishes installing packages from the 2nd CD, you can install optional or language-specific packages from the 3rd CD. The mechanism is the same: selecting categories, packages and then install them.

\section{Basic configuration}
\label{section:baseconfig}

After the installation of the packages Frugalware setup will configure your kernel modules. This means that an informer dialog appears, but nothing more.

After module configuration, you should change the root password. This is very important as there is no default password, if you skip this step, anybody will be able to login as root. After this step, you can create a normal (also known as non-root) user. It's highly recommended to create one, and log in as a normal user. If a command should be run as root, then you should use {\tt su}.

After this, setup will configure your network settings. Setup simply runs the {\tt netconfig} utility. We'll discuss that program later, in section \ref{section:netconfig}.

If network installation is done, we should configure the system's time. This means two actions. First, you should decide if the hardware clock is set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC/GMT). If yes, select {\tt yes} there. If the hardware clock is set to the current local time (this is how most PCs are set up), then say {\tt no} there. If you are not sure what this is, you should answer {\tt no} there.

Next step is to configure your mouse. The configuration will take effect on the console mouse services ({\tt gpm}) and on the X server. (The setting is used by {\tt xconfig} later). 

If you have installed an X server (by default {\tt xorg}), then setup would run {\tt xconfig}. For more information on {\tt xconfig} see section \ref{section:xconfig}.

\section{Package management basics}

Frugalware comes with Judd Vinet's great work, with the {\tt pacman} package manager. If you want to do anything with packages, you'll always have to use the {\tt pacman} command. Here is some basic action with pacman:

Actions usually used with remote installation from an ftp server:

{\tt pacman -Sy} Updates the package database. Before searching for packages or installing them from ftp server, you will need this command.

{\tt pacman -Su} Upgrades all packages that are currently installed but a newer version of the package is available on the ftp server.

{\tt pacman -Sup} Prints the URL of all packages that {\tt pacman} should download. In this way you can download the packages anywhere and then you should only copy them to {\tt /var/cache/pacman/pkg}. This is very useful if you have only limited bandwidth at your computer, but can access high bandwidth elsewhere.

{\tt pacman -S sendmail} Installs sendmail with all it's dependencies from the ftp server. If it conflicts with any package, you will be asked if pacman are allowed to remove them.

{\tt pacman -Ss perl} Searches in the package database. This will probably display the {\tt perl} package, and all perl modules.

Of course, you can deal with packages as normal files, and you can manually add/remove/etc them. Here are some examples:

{\tt pacman -U zsh-4.2.1-1.fpm} This adds (or if it's already installed, upgrades) the zsh package, which is located in the current directory.

{\tt pacman -R qt} This removes the qt package.

{\tt pacman -Q |grep perl} This shows every installed package whose name contains the \textit{perl} string.

Generally, if you want to turn off checking for conflicting files, you can use the {\tt -f} parameter, and if you want to turn off all dependency checking you should use the {\tt -d} switch.

{\tt pacman -h} This displays all the switches we discussed above and a lot more. Once again, these are only the basics.
