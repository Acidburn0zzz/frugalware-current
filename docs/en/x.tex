\section{Configuring your graphics card}
\label{section:xconfig}

If you install X, setup will automatically run {\tt xconfig}, our X configuration utility. First, xconfig will detect your configuration and will create a simple configuration file. Then it will ask you about the screen resolution and depth. Then, it will create the real configuration file with the following extras:

\begin{itemize}
\item Automatically configures mouse wheel, if found
\item Sets keyboard layout, according to the selected language
\item Enables DPMS
\item Allows users to use the DRI extension
\end{itemize}

After generating the config file it will start the X server and you will have to click to the {\tt OK} button, so {\tt xconfig} will know that the configuration was really successfull.

\section{3D acceleration (and binary drivers)}

If X has built-in 3d acceleration support for your card, then {\tt xconfig} will write the necessary entries to {\tt /etc/X11/xorg.conf} and X will load those module(s). 

If you have an ATI or NVidia card, then you will probably
need binary drivers. Obtaining these driver is fairly
simple:

{\tt \$ su -c 'pacman -Sy nvidia'}

or

{\tt \$ su -c 'pacman -Sy fglrx'}

\textbf{Warning:} you'll have to re-run {\tt pacman -S nvidia/fglrx} after each kernel update!
